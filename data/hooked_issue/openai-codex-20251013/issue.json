      "body": "When you start codex it asks you to put your API key in an environment variable:\n\n```\nMissing OpenAI API key.\n\nSet the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY and re-run this command.\nYou can create a key here: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys\n```\n\nIt would be preferable if it just prompted you for a key and it stored it securely, i.e., in the OS keystore (like the macOS keychain). It would also be better to use a bespoke key for codex rather than just a generic \"openai API key\". \n\nIt would also be nice if it just opened the browser to a page where you authenticate and generated a key for you (Claude Code does this).

Add `export OPENAI_API_KEY=\"sk-proj-xxxx\"` to  `~/.zshrc` and source it (`source ~/.zshrc`)\n3. `npm install -g @openai/codex`\n4. `mkdir listing-web && cd listing-web && git init`\n5. `codex -m o4-mini -a full-auto --image someimage.jpg` also `codex \"what can you do?\"`\n\n**Expected result**\n- Not to reject my call\n\n**Steps tried to mitigate**\n- Create new API Key\n\nEDIT: Fixed typo in commands",

Install the latest CLI:\n    ```bash\n    npm install -g @openai/codex\n    ```\n 2. Start an interactive session:\n    ```bash\n    codex\n    ```\n 3. Enter or paste a very long prompt (or build up many turns) until you see:\n    ```\n    — 1% context left\n    ```\n 4. Continue chatting or issue another prompt.\n 5. Observe the CLI crash with a stack trace similar to:\n    ```text\n    file:///…/codex/dist/cli.js:443\n    …pg.NEWLINE_REGEXP=/\\r\\n|[\\n\\r]/g;function Fwe(e,t){…}\n    …\n    [Error]: The server had an error while processing your request. Sorry about that!\n        at e.a [as iterator] (…/cli.js:443:1514)\n        at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/…)\n        at async I0.run (…/cli.js:460:2356) {\n      status: undefined,\n      headers: undefined,\n      request_id: undefined,\n      error: {\n        type: 'server_error',\n        message: 'The server had an error while processing your request. Sorry about that!',\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n ## Expected Behavior\n - Detect that the context window is exhausted (or about to be) and either:\n   1. Prompt the user to trim or clear history (e.g. suggest `/clear`),  \n   2. Automatically drop the oldest tokens before continuing, or  \n   3. Smart auto-compact mechanism\n   4. At minimum, emit a clear warning instead of an unhandled server error.  \n\n ## Actual Behavior\n Once the API rejects due to context overflow, the CLI surfaces a raw server error stack trace and exits.\n\n ## Environment\n - macOS 13.5  \n - Node.js v20.18.3 (via nvm)  \n - No custom configuration\n\n",

This is similar to interactive mode, but it also allows non-interactive consumers to pass message history properly in the standard openai message format. \n\nI'm currently working on an API server at https://github.com/Flux159/codex-api-server that could then expose this functionality to other clients via HTTP/S (with auth) - allowing a number of other clients to be built with codex without being restricted by the terminal api. \n\n## Storing history\n\nThere's another potential command around history that may be useful purely for the interactive CLI `--save-history`. Essentially it would store chat history in `~/.codex/chats`. This would allow a user to restart an interactive session with a previous history by using `--load-history ~/.codex/chats/chat-1.json` without losing the intermediate messages & context.",

Error details: \nStatus: 404, Code: 404, Type: unknown, \nMessage: 404 Resource not found. Please verify your settings and try again.\n```\n\nI also tried setting these values in `.codex/config.yaml` but still got the same error.\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Ask\n\nCould someone help confirm:\n1. Is Codex CLI compatible with Azure OpenAI?\n2. If yes, what’s the correct way to configure it for a custom deployment like o4-mini?\n3. Is there a different env var required for specifying the deployment name?\n\nWould appreciate a quick fix or workaround here—blocking usage on our end.

      "body": "# Tried this in Powershell -- needs some TLC\n> I don't use powershell as my default except on Windows. I'm sure this would have been OK in linux/mac (I'll test those too). I happened to be on Windows this morning because I was gaming last night before bed.\n\n1. Codex used my wsl installation to run commands (this is fine)\n2. It failed at using it though.\n3. It couldn't even figure out how to list the files using native Powershell and eventually used `git ls-files` (clever)\n\n## Shouldn't codex know what OS it's on and leverage the shell it is currently running from?\n- `dir`, or such would have worked straight away\n- because codex knew it was possible to try `wsl` it must have also known it was running on Windows?\n\n## After this, I simply asked \"What is the difference between o4-mini and o3-mini\"\n1. It tried to treat these models as files by grepping for them. \n2. It eventually got it right that these were models.\n\nThis seems odd, and I know this is new so wanted to report it. \n\nI love that you're providing us a CLI! It just needs some TLC and context awareness.\n\nI'd suggest some basic awareness if it's not already in place:\n- OS\n- Current shell / parent process\n- Environment variables from the OS\n- Introspection on available tooling (gnu, native windows, native mac, whatever, and any available package managers brew, choco, npm, etc.)\n- Perhaps a deeper introspection could be run at first start and later re-run to refresh it or something, where shallow introspection could just look at the shell, env, etc. and refer to what was previously found? (just an idea)\n\nThanks OpenAI!",

      "body": "## Summary\n\nCodex wrote this issue for me:\nCurrently any 429 \"rate limit\" response from the OpenAI API bubbles all the way out and causes the Codex‑CLI process to crash. We should instead catch rate‑limit errors, wait (with exponential back‑off), and retry automatically, so brief spikes don't kill the user's session.\n\n## Problem\n\n- Hitting the OpenAI API rate limit immediately aborts the CLI.\n- Users lose work/context when a single 429 becomes an unhandled exception.\n- There is no way to tune retry parameters or gracefully recover.\n\n## Proposal\n\n1. Introduce a helper, e.g. `codex/utils/openai_backoff.py`:\n   ```python\n   import time\n   from openai.error import RateLimitError, OpenAIError\n\n   def openai_with_backoff(fn, *args, max_retries=10, initial_delay=1.0, **kwargs):\n       \"\"\"\n       Wrap any OpenAI call (fn) so on RateLimitError it waits and retries\n       with exponential backoff (capped at e.g. 60s).\n       \"\"\"\n       delay = initial_delay\n       for attempt in range(max_retries):\n           try:\n               return fn(*args, **kwargs)\n           except RateLimitError:\n               print(f\"⏳ Rate limit hit, sleeping {delay:.1f}s (attempt {attempt+1}/{max_retries})\")\n               time.sleep(delay)\n               delay = min(delay * 2, 60.0)\n           except OpenAIError:\n               raise\n       raise RuntimeError(f\"OpenAI call failed after {max_retries} retries\")\n   ```\n\n2. Monkey‑patch the two main entrypoints in startup (e.g. in `codex/cli.py`):\n   ```python\n   import openai\n   from codex.utils.openai_backoff import openai_with_backoff\n\n   _orig_chat = openai.ChatCompletion.create\n   openai.ChatCompletion.create = lambda *args, **kw: openai_with_backoff(_orig_chat, *args, **kw)\n\n   _orig_comp = openai.Completion.create\n   openai.Completion.create = lambda *args, **kw: openai_with_backoff(_orig_comp, *args, **kw)\n   ```\n\n3. Expose `max_retries`/`initial_delay` in user config or CLI flags.\n4. Add unit tests that simulate `openai.error.RateLimitError` and verify retry logic.\n\n## Benefits\n\n* CLI no longer crashes on intermittent rate limits.\n* Configurable retry policy for power users.\n* Better out‑of‑the‑box resilience under heavy load.\n",

I had codex running at the root folder of the project (millions of lines of code, spread across directories). I gave a lengthy instruction with explicit file names to swift for and method names to study, however it was unable to look for the methods oddly (claude code is able to do this easily, for context) and then it started searching in the `DerivedData` folder (which is marked as a hidden folder within the same project folder: `.DerivedData.noindex`). It then wasted the entire context on this. \n\nCodex understood it's looking under the wrong folder but even after _adjustments_ it continued looking under DerivedData till it suddenly quit with a rate_limit error:\n\n```\nSearching for alarm templates\n\n    I’m not finding any matches, which makes me wonder if it’s actually supposed to be spelled as '-defaultAlarmTemplatesForEventType:' without a prefix. Since\n    grep found nothing, it suggests this code might not be in the current repository. It’s possible that it resides in macOS-calendaring frameworks or maybe it’s\n    hidden in Objective-C files. To dig deeper, I’m going to search for \"AlarmTemplates\" next.\n\n    thinking for 54s\n\n    thinking for 54s\n\n    command\n\n    $ grep -R AlarmTemplate -n .\n\n    command.stdout (code: 143, duration: 10s)\n\n    Binary file ./calendar/.DerivedData.noindex/BusyCal/Index.noindex/DataStore/v5/records/PC/CalendarWC+Menu_Edit.m-X7CO5DPE91PC matches\n    Binary file ./calendar/.DerivedData.noindex/BusyCal/Index.noindex/DataStore/v5/records/YQ/PrefsController+TimedEventAlarms.m-3IJEW4UF6NXYQ matches\n    Binary file ./calendar/.DerivedData.noindex/BusyCal/Index.noindex/DataStore/v5/records/SJ/BirthdaySyncTask.m-25TBHWRI9IMSJ matches\n    Binary file ./calendar/.DerivedData.noindex/BusyCal/Index.noindex/DataStore/v5/records/9X/PrefsController.h-LIMW3D9IY89X matches\n    ... (342 more lines)\n\n    thinking for 74s\n\n    Refining search paths\n\n    I noticed that the grep command returned excessive output, with many automatically generated Swift headers from the DerivedData directory. That's definitely\n    not useful! I need to focus on source code definitions in Swift or Objective-C files instead. Since this project is an Xcode project, I'll refocus my search\n    specifically inside the calendar/ directory and ignore DerivedData altogether. It seems I need to adjust my grep command to skip the DerivedData directory for\n    a cleaner search.\n\n    thinking for 74s\n\n    thinking for 74s\n\n    thinking for 74s\n```\n\n### What is the expected behavior?\n\nLook for the correct code, ignore hidden folders with a `.`\n\n### What do you see instead?\n\nSearching the wrong folders, unable to find correctly specified method name (its prefix) in a obj-c .m file in one of the sub-folders.\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",

It seems this system wasn't really ready for release with all the issues going on, like not implementing cooldown feature knowing OpenAI implements a tiered rate limit. Seeking out using other models reveals they cannot properly use Codex. \n\n### What is the expected behavior?\n\nCompetent outputs from available models to use. \n\n### What do you see instead?\n\nVarious errors. For example GPT-4o will say \n\n> Error: spawn cat /home/was/projects/codex/yeti_toolkit/yeti/sdk/io.py ENOENT\n\n> codex\n> It seems we're having persistent issues accessing the file. To move forward, could you try providing the exact\n    content or confirming whether the path is accessible from your current working environment? This would help further\n    debug and address the syntax issue.\n\nThe path is accessible, file is there, and previously edited by another model. Similarly GPT 4.1 will says\n\n>     Error: spawn cat /home/was/projects/codex/yeti_toolkit/yeti/sdk/io.py ENOENT\n\n>   codex\n    It appears there's a problem with accessing the file. Could you check if the file path is correct or if there are\n    permissions issues? Alternatively, let me know if there might be another way to access or verify the file content.\n\nI'll also often get the following with all models besides o4-mini:\n\n``` \n[Error]: An error occurred while processing your request.

This all should have been pretty rigorously tested prior to launch.\n\nI've tried rolling back to working versions of the software from from github that it should have context on, and even unreleased version from our gitlab, these other models just aren't working with Codex. \n\nSo far I have chewed through 10 dollars, for no output...

While using the tool, I noticed that the code modifications suggested by the assistant are not reflected in my local repository. Instead, it appears that these changes are made within an ephemeral environment that doesn't persist or affect my local files.\n\nI attempted to verify if there were any environmental protections preventing file changes by executing the following commands:\n\n$ touch __codex_write_test__\n$ rm __codex_write_test__\nThese commands executed successfully, indicating that there are no file system protections in place.\n\nGiven this, I am trying to understand:\n\nWhere is the \"ephemeral container or environment\" located? Is there a specific directory or path where these changes are made?\n\nIs this behavior expected? If so, what is the recommended workflow to apply the assistant's suggestions to my local codebase?\n\nAre there plans to enable direct modifications to the local repository in future updates?\n\nAnother example here, why does Codex switch from auto editing my files, to then not auto editing my files. For example I have two  separate conversation here generated in the same session. Codex, first applies the change. Then later on in the conversation it suggests I drop in the files to \"run the code\". Why does Codex do this? It appears to be able to make code changes, and then it stops making the requested changes I want. \n\n\n\n  File \"/home/student/apps/gfsCopy/venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pandas/core/indexing.py\", line 1752, in _getitem_axis\n    self._validate_integer(key, axis)\n  File \"/home/student/apps/gfsCopy/venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pandas/core/indexing.py\", line 1685, in _validate_integer\n    raise IndexError(\"single positional indexer is out-of-bounds\")\nIndexError: single positional indexer is out-of-bounds\n\n    thinking for 26s\n\n    command\n\n    $ apply_patch << 'EOF'\n    *** Begin Patch\n    *** Update File: weather_trading/signals/fundamental_risk.py\n    @@ class FundamentalRiskScorer:\n    -    def compute_risk_score(self, combined_df: pd.DataFrame, eia_storage_df: pd.DataFrame) -> float:\n    -        \"\"\"\n    -        For demonstration, define a ratio = total storage / combined demand, then invert it for a \"tightness\" measure.\n    -        \"\"\"\n    -        if \"combined_metric\" in combined_df.columns:\n    -            demand_est = float(combined_df[\"combined_metric\"].iloc[0])  # placeholder\n    -        else:\n    -            demand_est = 1.0\n    +    def compute_risk_score(self, combined_df: pd.DataFrame, eia_storage_df: pd.DataFrame) -> float:\n    +        \"\"\"\n    +        For demonstration, define a ratio = total storage / combined demand, then invert it for a \"tightness\" measure.\n    +        \"\"\"\n    +        # Handle empty DataFrame or missing column\n    +        if combined_df.empty or \"combined_metric\" not in combined_df.columns:\n    +            self.logger.info(\"No combined_metric available; defaulting demand_est to 1.0 for risk score\")\n    +            demand_est = 1.0\n    +        else:\n    +            try:\n    +                demand_est = float(combined_df[\"combined_metric\"].iloc[0])\n    +                if demand_est == 0.0:\n    +                    demand_est = 1.0\n    +            except Exception:\n    +                self.logger.exception(\"Error reading combined_metric; defaulting demand_est to 1.0\")\n    +                demand_est = 1.0\n    *** End Patch\n    EOF\n\n    command.stdout (code: 0, duration: 0s)\n\n    Done!\n\n    thinking for 44s\n\n    thinking for 45s\n\n    command\n\n    $ export SKIP_EIA=true TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN= TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=; venv/bin/python app.py --once\n\n    command.stdout (code: 1, duration: 4.4s)\n\n    2025-04-21 13:50:50 | INFO | __main__ | ==== Starting Weather App ====\n    2025-04-21 13:50:50 | INFO | __main__ | === Running single forecast routine (once) ===\n    2025-04-21 13:50:50 | INFO | weather.forecast_runner | === Starting forecast routine (with daily/weekly aggregation) ===\n    2025-04-21 13:50:50 | INFO | weather.forecast_loader | Attempting to download GFS data from NOAA S3...\n    ...

      "body": "### What version of Codex is running?\n\n0.1.2504181820\n\n### Which model were you using?\n\no4-mini\n\n### What platform is your computer?\n\nLinux 6.6.84-1-MANJARO x86_64 unknown\n\n### What steps can reproduce the bug?\n\nAwesome — here’s a ready-to-go GitHub issue for you to post:\n\n**Summary**  \nCodex CLI hangs at the `\"Initializing agent…\"` stage, even after receiving a successful `200 OK` response from the OpenAI API. This is not the same as hanging on \"Thinking…\", the backend clearly responds, but Codex never proceeds.\n\n---\n**Environment**  \n\n- Running in Docker using the official `run_in_container.sh` sandbox\n---\n\n**Steps to reproduce**\n\n1. Launch Codex in a project directory:\n   ```bash\n   codex \"explain generate_cuts.py\"\n   ```\n2. Wait until it reaches `Thinking…`, then:\n3. Observe the CLI output freeze on:\n   ```\n   Initializing agent…\n   ```\n\n4. Set `DEBUG=true` and rerun. Observe this key log snippet:\n\n   ```bash\n   OpenAI:DEBUG:response 200 https://api.openai.com/v1/responses e [Headers] {\n     'openai-processing-ms': [ '1144' ],\n     'x-request-id': [ 'req_…' ],\n     ...\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Yet Codex does not move forward from `\"Initializing agent…\"`, and never returns a result.\n\n### What is the expected behavior?\n\nCodex should proceed with displaying the agent’s reasoning and response after receiving a valid API response.\n\nLet me know if you need more logs — happy to help reproduce.\n\n\n### What do you see instead?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\nRe-running Codex with `DEBUG=true` shows that **OpenAI API responds correctly** with `200 OK`, and the CLI logs full streamed output. The issue occurs **after** receiving several valid responses — when it reaches:\n\n```shell\nInitializing agent…\n```\n\nCodex **never recovers** from that point.\n\n**Key log snippets:**\n\n```bash\nOpenAI:DEBUG:response 200 https://api.openai.com/v1/responses e [Headers] {\n  ...\n  'x-request-id': [ 'req_e1f39bff9f4066679f1dd99d2a467186' ],\n  'openai-processing-ms': [ '1144' ],\n  ...\n}\n\ncommand.stdout (code: 0, duration: 0s)\n$ grep -R \"def assign_labels\" -n generate_cuts.py\n\n... hangs here ...\n\nInitializing agent…\n```",

      "body": "## Summary\nI am proposing a better way to handle model specific information. My opinion on the current approach is that it will create a snowball of one-off util methods to get model information, rather than just having a model config that serves as the single source of truth.\n\nThis will be a mutli-part PR that can be rolled out individually to make it easier to track. **[Part 1 has already been mocked out](https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/551)** - just gathering feedback on if we think this is needed.\n\n### Part 1\n- Create the initial model info structure, starting with focus on context length management. \n```javascript\nexport const modelInfo = {\n    \"o1-pro-2025-03-19\": {\n        label: \"O1 Pro (2025-03-19)\",\n        maxContextLength: 200000,\n    },\n    /// ... all other models to be supported\n};\n```\n\nThis will just effect the `model-utils` context window calculation. Right now it uses the model name to guess context - this will replace that with something along the lines of this\n```javascript\nfunction maxTokensForModel(model: SupportedModelId): number {\n  return openAiModelInfo[model].maxContextLength;\n}\n```\n\n### Part 2\nThis PR will focus on enhancing the current approach for pulling in models to choose from. The API only supports basic information like model IDs. Also, Codex is using ALL models that come from the OpenAI API... so things like `computer-use-preview` and `whisper` can be selected at this time (which obviously breaks).\n\n#### Option 1\n- Continue to use the API, and filter out all models that we do not have a config for. \n\n#### Option 2\n- Replace the API entirely with the model config from part 1.\n\n## Part 3\nThis PR will focus on changing out the `string` type being used for the model throughout the app with the new `SupportedModelId` type. This will essentially allow for static checking of supported models.\n\n## Future Enhancements\nHaving this config opens the door for other model-specific info in the future. \n\nSome things that come to mind:\n- In/Out price tracking\n- Feature support (images, caching, etc)\n",

Adaptive Delay rather than no delay:\n    - Use a smaller delay (perhaps 2-3ms) that still preserves readability\n    - Adjust delay based on token volume (faster for code, slower for explanations)\n2. Batch Processing:\n    - Process tokens immediately internally, but render in small batches\n    - This gives UI benefits of streaming without the processing overhead\n3. Token Throttling:\n    - Process all tokens immediately but throttle output rendering\n    - Implement a \"max tokens per second\" display rate (e.g., 30-50 tokens/sec)\n\nSimulating token streaming performance for 500 tokens:\n\nRunning balanced benchmark (optimized with a small delay)...\n\nBalanced approach results (new implementation):\n     - Total token processing time: 5.78ms\n     - Average token delay: 0.01ms\n     - P95 token delay: 0.01ms\n     - Tokens processed per second: 86509.55\n     - Total wall-clock time: 10.17ms\n\nRunning setTimeout benchmark (original implementation)...\n     setTimeout results (original implementation):\n     - Total token processing time: 5.95ms\n     - Average token delay: 0.01ms\n     - P95 token delay: 0.01ms\n     - Tokens processed per second: 84054.80\n     - Total wall-clock time: 17.10ms\n\n     ====== PERFORMANCE COMPARISON ======\n     Balanced approach vs Original (setTimeout):\n     - Wall-clock time reduction: 40.54%\n     - Average token delay reduction: 2.84%\n\n     Real-world impact using balanced approach:\n     - Small response (100 tokens): ~0.7s faster\n     - Medium response (500 tokens): ~3.5s faster\n     - Large response (2000 tokens): ~14.0s faster\n\n     The balanced implementation provides:\n     1.

Always wrap changes between “*** Begin Patch” and “*** End Patch”.\n        2. Specify the action (Add, Delete, Update, Rename) and the file path after the first marker line.\n        3. Show only the minimal diff (- and + lines) needed for the fix.\n        4. Let the system save the file; do not instruct the user to copy/paste it.\n\n    Using apply_patch keeps a clean git history and allows the sandbox to track and test your changes automatically.\nuser\nWhat about grep?\n\n    codex\n    To search the repository you can invoke the shell tool with a grep (or ripgrep / rg) command.  A typical pattern looks like this (remember: the function call itself must appear in the commentary channel, never the analysis\n    channel).\n\n    Example:\n\n        {\"name\": \"shell\",\n         \"arguments\": {\n           \"command\": [\"grep\", \"-R\", \"-n\", \"search_term\", \".\"]\n         }}\n\n    Guideline reminders:\n\n        1. Use the shell tool only from the commentary channel.\n        2. Keep the command minimal and safe (e.g., don’t pipe to destructive commands).\n        3. You can adjust flags (`-R`, `-n`, `--line-number`, etc.) or switch to `rg` if available for faster searches.\n        4. The tool returns the command’s stdout/stderr so you can inspect results and decide what to do next.\n`\n\n### What is the expected behavior?\n\n_No response_\n\n### What do you see instead?\n\nThe system prompt clearly outlines that grep should not be used and only ripgrep should be used. Codex will answer correctly the question \"Is grep allowed?\" if it's the first message, but not for any subsequent message\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",

With this server I'm trying to add task [with `add_omnifocus_task` command]. \n\nwhich can be attached by this command (running locally):\n\nbuild and install\n```bash\nnpm run build\nnpm link\n```\n\n`config.toml`\n```toml\n[mcp_servers.omni-focus]\ncommand = \"npx\"\nargs = [\"-y\", \"omnifocus-mcp\"]\n```\n\nThen you have to ask Codex in session the following:\n\n```\nAdd this task to omnifocus for 2025-08-28T15:00:00 for project Home:\n\n- Buy bread \\@Me \\@1\n```\n\n### What is the expected behavior?\n\nI expect the correct call:\n\n```json\n{\"deferDate\":\"2025-08-28 15:00\",\"name\":\"Buy bread\",\"projectName\":\"Home\",\"tags\":[\"Me\",\"1\"]}\n```\n\n### What do you see instead?\n\n\nThere are tree options which can happens from most frequent to less\n1. Codex hangs for eternity and starting to download kinda kbs of data from the gateway without putting anything on logs (check huge chung of new lines down the logs — it's the codex who created it)\n2. It not hangs, but creates formally not broken, but mostly insane JSON with a tool call\n3. It creates valid json. \n\nThe second point can vary from: \n\n```json\n{\n    \"id\": \"7cfdd614-bea3-403e-b2d5-77bf79a8de59\",\n    \"msg\": {\n        \"type\": \"mcp_tool_call_begin\",\n        \"call_id\": \"call_MkW4yFsRwJfX85EWxoWVuryj\",\n        \"server\": \"omni-focus\",\n        \"tool\": \"add_omnifocus_task\",\n        \"arguments\": {\n            \"1\": \"], \",\n            \"dueDate\\\": \": \"2025-08-28 15:00\",\n            \"dueDate\\\":\\\"2025-08-28 15:00\\\",\\\"projectName\\\":\\\"Home\\\",\\\"tags\\\":[\\\"Me\\\",\\\"1\\\"],\\\"estimatedMinutes\\\":1}议JSON깨ам到 पूछ json difí대슨 sna něk terminology?

      "body": "**Summary**\nAs a ChatGPT Pro user, I expected Codex CLI to work under my Pro plan without consuming API credits. However, the “Sign in with ChatGPT” flow **auto‑creates an API key** for my selected API org/project. If I revoke that key to avoid API charges, the CLI fails with `401 Incorrect API key provided` and then forces me to sign in again, which **creates a new API key**. In short, there seems to be **no way to use Codex CLI without an API key** being generated and billed to the API account.\n\n**Environment**\n\n* Codex CLI: `0.19.0`  (output of `codex --version`)\n* Install method: `npm i -g @openai/codex`\n* OS: Windows 11 (running in Git Bash / MINGW64; not using WSL for this repro)\n* Organization: `Personal` → `Default project`\n* Config directory: `~/.codex/` (an `auth.json` file appears after login)\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**\n\n1. Ensure no `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in the environment and remove any previous Codex state:\n\n   * Delete `~/.codex/` (or at least `~/.codex/auth.json`).\n2. Run `codex` and select **“Sign in with ChatGPT”**.\n3. In the browser, select my **API Organization** and **Default project**, then click **Continue**.\n4. Observe that an API key named **“Codex CLI (auto‑generated)”** is created in the API dashboard, and `~/.codex/auth.json` now holds credentials (including an `sk-proj-...` key).\n5. Revoke that auto‑generated key in the API dashboard.\n6. Run `codex` again.\n\n**Actual behavior**\n\n* The CLI shows:\n\n  ```\n  system  ⚠️ OpenAI rejected the request ...\n  Error details: Status: 401, Code: invalid_api_key, Message: 401 Incorrect API key provided: sk-proj-***********...\n  ```\n* The CLI asks me to log in again; completing login **creates a new API key**. I cannot run Codex CLI without having an active API key, which leads to API charges.\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\n* As a Pro user using **“Sign in with ChatGPT”**, I expected a mode that **does not create or require** an API key and **does not consume API credits**, or at least a clear toggle (“use ChatGPT plan entitlements only”).\n* If I “Disconnect” Codex CLI in ChatGPT settings or revoke the key, Codex CLI should not silently recreate a billable key.\n\n**What I tried (no change)**\n\n* Deleted `~/.codex/` and re‑logged in.\n* Ensured `OPENAI_API_KEY` is **unset**.\n* Revoked the “Codex CLI (auto‑generated)” key multiple times — CLI always re‑creates a new key after login.\n\n\n**Logs**\nFrom the CLI run after revoking the key (redacted):\n\n```\nsystem  ⚠️ OpenAI rejected the request (request ID: req_19a4b978fff39e57e93e03f92d4c027a).\nError details: Status: 401, Code: invalid_api_key, Type: invalid_request_error,\nMessage: 401 Incorrect API key provided: sk-proj-***eZoA.\n```\n\nI can also provide `~/.codex/log/codex-tui.log` with `RUST_LOG=codex_core=debug,codex_tui=debug` if needed.\n\n**Why I believe this is a bug/UX gap**\n\n* The official “Sign in with ChatGPT” docs say the flow **creates a key automatically** and that **Disconnect** only removes the OAuth grant, not the key itself. This appears to leave no path to run Codex CLI under a Pro plan **without** a billable API key.\n* The README also instructs users migrating from API key billing to ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is unset and re‑login; however, re‑login still auto‑creates a key, so billing remains tied to API.\n\n**Request**\n\n* Provide a “Pro/Plus entitlement” mode that does not rely on an API key (or at least a setting to **not** auto‑create one).\n* Alternatively, clearly document that Codex CLI currently **requires** an API key and **will** bill the API account (even for Pro users), and outline how/when this will change.\n* If a non‑API billing mode is planned, please share timelines or a beta flag we can test.\n\n<img width=\"616\" height=\"458\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65d2e59c-e083-4e3d-9384-8d7d173560dc\" />",

Unfortunately, this current reasoning is not exposed as an option in Codex CLI.\n\nTrying the following run command:\n`codex --ask-for-approval never --sandbox danger-full-access -c model_reasoning_effort=\"minimal\"\n`\nResults with the following error:\n```\nError loading configuration: unknown variant `minimal`, expected one of `low`, `medium`, `high`, `none`\nin `model_reasoning_effort`\n```\n\nRegarding the minimal reasoning effort functionality, please refer to the following articles:\n\"GPT‑5 with minimal reasoning is a different model than the non-reasoning model in ChatGPT, and is better tuned for developers.\" ([Source](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developers/))\n\n\"The new minimal setting produces very few reasoning tokens for cases where you need the fastest possible time-to-first-token. We often see better performance when the model can produce a few tokens when needed versus none. The default is medium.\n\nThe minimal setting performs especially well in coding and instruction following scenarios, adhering closely to given directions. However, it may require prompting to act more proactively. To improve the model's reasoning quality, even at minimal effort, encourage it to “think” or outline its steps before answering.\" ([Source](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/latest-model#minimal-reasoning-effort))\n\n\n\n### Are you interested in implementing this feature?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_",

Codex still reports timeouts when starting the MCP client.\n- Even after providing the signed token from Rube (Authorization or X-API-Key), Codex shows: `MCP client for 'rube' failed to start: request timed out`.\n\nSteps to Reproduce\n1) Add an MCP entry (stdio) that launches a small proxy which forwards to `https://rube.app/mcp` over Streamable HTTP with SSE fallback.\n\n```\n[mcp_servers.rube]\ncommand = \"/Users/danialhasan/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.0/bin/node\"\nargs = [\n  \"/Users/danialhasan/Desktop/dev.nosync/scripts/rube-proxy-node/index.mjs\"\n]\n# Token redacted; header can be Authorization or X-API-Key depending on provider docs\nenv = { RUBE_URL = \"https://rube.app/mcp\", RUBE_TOKEN = \"<redacted>\", RUBE_AUTH_HEADER = \"Authorization\" }\n```\n\n2) Restart Codex CLI and open a session.\n3) Observe error in TUI: `🖐 Failed to create MCP connection manager: request timed out` (and/or `MCP client for 'rube' failed to start: request timed out`).\n4) Proxy stderr with invalid token shows 401 from SSE; with token provided, Codex still times out at startup.\n\nExpected\n- Codex should support HTTP/Streamable HTTP/SSE MCP servers natively (e.g., `transport = \"http\"` with `url` and headers), or at least not time out when a stdio proxy is used.\n- On auth/network errors from the remote MCP server, surface the HTTP status/message instead of a generic startup timeout.\n\nActual\n- Codex fails to initialize the MCP connection with a generic timeout.\n- No actionable error details are surfaced in the TUI; proxy logs show SSE/HTTP behavior but Codex reports only a timeout.\n\nEnvironment\n- macOS 15.2 (arm64)\n- Codex CLI 0.29.0\n- Node.js v20.19.0 for stdio proxy (also tried Deno 2.4.4)\n- Deno and Node proxies both attempted; Node 20 used to avoid older Node fetch/stream incompatibilities\n\nAdditional Notes / Attempts\n- Direct TOML with `transport = \"http\"` + `url` was rejected by Codex config parser (requires `[mcp_servers.<name>]` with `command`).\n- Deno-based stdio proxy worked functionally but still resulted in `request timed out` from Codex.\n- Node-based proxy (using `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.17.5) connects in background; still see Codex timeout on client start with valid token and header.\n\nRelated Issues\n- #2129 Feature Request: Native SSE transport support for MCP servers\n- #2320 SSE based MCP servers are non-configurable\n- #2550 feat: enable Streamable HTTP MCP servers & lazy loading of tools\n- #2555 Windows 11: MCP server (Context7) fails with “request timed out”\n- #3182 feat(mcp): per-server timeout and capture server stdout/stderr\n- #2346 Make MCP Request timeout configurable\n\nRequest\n- Add native support for HTTP/Streamable HTTP/SSE MCP servers in `~/.codex/config.toml` (e.g., `transport = \"http\"`, `url`, and `headers`).\n- Improve error propagation so Codex surfaces HTTP status (401/403/405) and response body from remote MCP servers on startup.\n- Document recommended auth header handling for HTTP MCP (Authorization vs X-API-Key) with examples.\n- Consider a per-server configurable connect timeout and retry policy.\n\nHappy to provide a minimal proxy repo or more logs if helpful.\n",

Create a JSON Schema file (e.g. schema.json) describing the expected final answer.\n2. Run codex exec --output-schema schema.json -m gpt-5-codex 'tell me a joke'.\n3. Observe via logging or a mock server that the outbound payload’s text field is null/missing; the response is unstructured text instead of JSON.\n4. Repeat with -m gpt-5; the schema is honored and the model returns JSON.\n\n### What is the expected behavior?\n\nCodex models also support the `--output-schema` flag.\n\n### What do you see instead?\n\n  - The new --output-schema feature attaches a JSON Schema via the OpenAI Responses text.format field, but the client only includes that block when model_family.family == \"gpt-5\" (core/src/client.rs:187).\n  - For any Codex-branded model (slugs starting with gpt-5-codex or codex-), find_family_for_model assigns family to the slug itself (core/src/model_family.rs:70-79), so the equality check never passes.\n  - As a result, running codex exec --output-schema schema.json -m gpt-5-codex … (or any other Codex slug) sends a request without text.format, the schema is dropped, and the model produces unconstrained free-form output. This is already in the 0.41.0 release.\n\n### Additional information\n\n**Scope / Impact**\n\n- All Codex-family models using the new --output-schema path ignore the schema, so the flagship use case of constrained Codex output does not work in 0.41.0.\n- Feature works only for plain GPT‑5 slugs, so parity across model presets is broken.\n\n**Suspected Fix**\n\n- Broaden the guard in core/src/client.rs to include model families whose slug starts with gpt-5-codex (and likely other Codex prefixes) before calling create_text_param_for_request, rather than relying on an exact \"gpt-5\" match.",

Settings: model gpt-5-codex, reasoning high.\n\nAsk the agent to commit staged changes (e.g., “commit: consolidate gait resolver and canonical columns tests”).\n\nAgent runs only two trivial commands:\n\ngit status -sb\n\ngit commit -m '<short message>'\n\nWatch the Codex token counter in the status bubble.\n\nObserved run: token meter jumped from 5,495k to 5,661k while only those two git commands executed.\n\n### What is the expected behavior?\n\nToken usage for a simple commit (status + commit) should remain in the low thousands at most. Utility/git tasks should not trigger repo-wide context pulls or repeated mega-prompts. It shouldnt be using 150K tokens????? I notice my weekly usage is wayyy higher than it ever has been before and im still doing the same amount of coding with codex. \n\n### What do you see instead?\n\nToken usage massively jumps for a commit that only stages/tests and runs git commit.\nUI shows 5,495k → 5,661k tokens during two commands. (2020% → 2112%, also insanely high %)\n\n\n### Additional information\n\npls reset token usage, vs code IDE extension is sky rocketing my weekly usage %, and i just paid another month of PRO LOL. \n\n",
